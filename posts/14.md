[T-DOSE](http://www.t-dose.org/) 2014 was held two weeks ago.  A lot
of Dutch fellows were there, and of course we brought the
[FSFE](https://fsfe.org) booth.

On Saturday, I gave a talk about the ["Internet of Things"]
(https://blogs.fsfe.org/flx/2014/11/09/my-t-dose-talk-the-internet-of-things-opportunities-and-dangers/)
and Kevin Keijzer about [Discrimination of free software (users) in
education] (http://www.t-dose.org/node/804); Maurice spoke on Sunday
about ["Digital Sovereignty For Europe"]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2GsjF0UQ6k&list=PLBZBIkixHEidJ05uKM6orHYps0A0uNQ94&index=8)

I also volunteered at the [Privacy Caf√©] (https://privacycafe.nl/)
(see also [this earlier post]
