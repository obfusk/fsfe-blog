I led a workshop on Privacy and Free Software at FSFE's Germanophone
Team Meeting 2014.  Here's a summary.

## Privacy Café

The [Privacy Café](https://privacycafe.nl/) is an initiative of Dutch
digital rights organisation [Bits of
Freedom](https://www.bof.nl/home/english-bits-of-freedom/).  Its
purpose is to teach people to protect their privacy.  They call it
**"digital self-defence"**.

Whilst the Privacy Café has a lot in common with
[CryptoParties](https://www.cryptoparty.in/), there are some notable
differences:

* It usually takes place in a **public library** (instead of e.g. a
  hackerspace).
* It targets a **non-technical audience** (which is why a public
  library is a very good venue).

The Privacy Café has a **"menu"** with

* **starters** like Firefox, https everywhere, startpage.com, choosing
  good passwords, automatic updates, screen locking, hard disk
  encryption;
* **main courses** like Tor, GnuPG, OTR, Tails;
* and **desserts** like tosdr.org, prism-break.org, xkcd.com.

Volunteers from Bits of Freedom and hackerspaces (and sometimes FSFE)
are there to answer questions, help people choose from the menu and
install and configure the software.

Sometimes, there are also lightning talks.  I gave one about [the
importance of Free
Software](https://blogs.fsfe.org/flx/2014/05/07/the-importance-of-free-software/)
at the Privacy Café in
[Utrecht](https://blogs.fsfe.org/flx/2014/05/18/privacy-cafe-in-utrecht/).

## Software Freedom

The people that go to a Privacy Café are *already aware* of issues
surrounding privacy and freedom.  This gives us an opportunity to tell
them about Free Software.  A good place to start is by asking them
**"who controls the software?"**.

## Remarks from the Workshop

* The timing is right, since awareness of privacy themes is very high
  at the moment and those who worry about privacy are already aware of
  the importance of *freedom*.  This makes it much easier to show the
  link between *freedom* and *control* and Free Software.
* It is unfortunate that the theme of Free Software is not already at
  the foreground, even though it is necessary for privacy.
* We need *all four freedoms*, not just the ability to audit the
  software (i.e. source availability).
* The menu metaphor is good (like the tools metaphor in the "tools
  leaflet").
* Using a public library as a venue is good, since it takes privacy
  out of the domain of hackers and "nerds" and makes it more
  approachable for non-technical people.
* Free Software and encryption can be made more attractive with proper
  attention to presentation (e.g. websites and handouts).

## Ideas from the Workshop

* Making it more "fun" by using symbols (for signatures), stickers
  (for laptops) to show e.g. what "level" one has achieved.
* Finish Lucile's privacy flyer draft so it can be used for
  similar events.
* Organise something similar (e.g. in Unperfekthaus).

## non-free encryption software

What to do when those groups who teach encryption do so using non-free
software?

* Working together is desirable, so we have more Free Software people
  in the group and can explain our topic.
* We should keep emphasising that only Free Software can ensure
  security (Kerckhoffs's principle).
* FSFE will never promote non-free software, and advises volunteers to
  also not recommend non-free software, but rather explain the issues
  mentioned above.
