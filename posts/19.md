Dear FSFE Fellow,

For those of you reading this post because you're trying to decide who
to vote for in the upcoming [**Fellowship
Election**](https://wiki.fsfe.org/FellowshipElection_2015) (which
starts 20 February), I've tried to provide **a little bit of
information about myself and my candidature**.

## About me

I'm FSFE's [Deputy Coordinator](https://fsfe.org/about/team)
[Netherlands](https://wiki.fsfe.org/groups/BNL).  I've been a Fellow
since 2008.  You can read about some of the things I've done for FSFE
last year in my [blog post about FSFE Netherlands in 2014][nl].

[nl]: https://blogs.fsfe.org/flx/2015/01/26/fsfe-netherlands-in-2014/

I also volunteer at (Dutch digital rights organisation) [Bits of
Freedom](https://bof.nl)'s [Privacy Caf√©](https://privacycafe.nl) (and
other [CryptoParties](https://cryptoparty.in)).

I'm currently studying Computer Science & Cyber Security at Radboud
University in the Netherlands.

I'm interested in *Privacy*, *Security*, *Free Software*, *Freedom and
(Digital) Civil Rights*; as well as *Mathematics*, *Computer Science*
and *Software Development*.  I also enjoy *teaching* and *speaking*.

## My goals

I'm highly motivated to do more for the FSFE.  I'd like to:

  * continue the Dutch team's **transborder activities** with
    Fellows from Germany and Belgium;
  * be more active on **team@**;
  * and **improve communication & cooperation** with (Dutch)
    **Fellows**, other **organisations & communities**, and the
    **general public**.

Being a Fellowship representative would provide me with a great
opportunity to do this (and more).

## Who to vote for?

I think Max & Nicolas would be great Fellowship representatives as
well and **we seem to share many of the same goals**.

So I'm **not going to tell you why you should elect me** instead of
one of them -- although **I certainly hope you'll vote for me**.

Instead, I want to tell you that **no matter who wins the election**,
I intend to **work together with Max & Nicolas** -- and all of you --
**to make FSFE even better**.
